Classification of Valvular Heart Disease Using Machine Learning Algorithms

In this study, I worked on the classification of Valvular Heart Disease (VHD) types using the Classification of Coronary Artery Disease dataset from Kaggle. I preprocessed the dataset to transform the VHD feature into four separate binary columns: VHD_Severe, VHD_Mild, VHD_Moderate, and VHD_N.

I applied and compared the performance of the following machine learning algorithms:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Naive Bayes
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
A Custom Distance Metric Enhanced kNN
A Kernel Function Enhanced Support Vector Regression
The models were evaluated using performance metrics, including Accuracy, True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), False Negatives (FN), Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision, and F1-Score.

This analysis aims to provide insights into the effective detection and classification of VHD types, contributing to early diagnosis and decision support in healthcare.
