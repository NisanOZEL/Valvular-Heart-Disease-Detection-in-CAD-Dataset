# Valvular-Heart-Disease-Detection-in-CAD-Dataset
Using the Classification of Coronary Artery Disease dataset from Kaggle, I classified Valvular Heart Disease (VHD) types (Severe, Mild, Moderate, N) with models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, kNN, and custom algorithms. Models were evaluated using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, and F1-Score.
